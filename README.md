# Downloads Folder Sorter (DFS)

DFS (Downloads Folder Sorter) is a Python script designed to help you organize your cluttered downloads folder by automatically sorting files into specific directories based on their file types. This script is optimized for Windows.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create directories and move files within your "Downloads" folder.

## JSON File Configuration

The filetypes.json file contains the mapping of file types to their corresponding target directories. The script reads this JSON data to determine where to move each file.

You can modify this JSON file to match your specific file type preferences and target directories.

## Disclaimer

Please use this script responsibly and make sure to back up your important files before running it. While the script attempts to be accurate in categorizing files, unexpected results may occur based on the contents of your "Downloads" folder and the JSON file configuration.
